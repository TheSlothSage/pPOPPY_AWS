### Get all components

The full BOM list is available [here](../../hardware/doc/BOM.md), please ensure you get everything you need to start the construction of your Poppy Humanoid.

The most convenient way, is to order a complete Poppy Humanoid kit from one of the [certified distributors](https://www.poppy-project.org/poppy-dealers/).


### Assembly instructions

The documentation to build your Poppy Humanoid is available [here](../../hardware/doc/Poppy_Humanoid_assembly_instructions.md). It is a modular documentation so you can create groups and split assembly work on several groups.

Please note that the current head assembly documentation is not finished.


## Use Poppy Humanoid

### Setup the embedded computer

When you get you brand new Odroid U3 board, you will need to install all software needed to control your robot. Do not worry, there is a script to do it automatically, you just have to follow the instruction available [here](https://github.com/poppy-project/poppy_install/blob/master/README.md).


### Software

Poppy Humanoid is programmed in python using the [pypot library](//github.com/poppy-project/pypot/) which full documentation is available [here](http://poppy-project.github.io/pypot/).

Build on top of this library, there are several ready-to-use pieces of code you can find in the [poppy_humanoid package](../../software/poppy_humanoid/).
