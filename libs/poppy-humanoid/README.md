===================
[![PyPI](https://img.shields.io/pypi/v/poppy-humanoid.svg)](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/poppy-humanoid/)

Poppy Humanoid is an open-source and 3D printed humanoid robot. Optimized for research and education purposes, its modularity allows for a wide range of applications and experimentations.

### Looking for the Solidworks files ?

We are using a GitHub feature called GIT LFS. It is great for versionning solidworks files but it stills lack basic features. If you download directly solidworks files from this web page, you will get an empty file...

You have two option:

1. Download the last official Solidworks version in the [release](https://github.com/poppy-project/poppy-humanoid/releases). You will also find STL, STEP and parasolid files.
- Clone locally this repository following [this guide](doc/en/cloning.md). This solution is only for people desiring to contribute or develop news hardware features for Poppy.

## Build your own Poppy Humanoid

Building a complete Poppy Humanoid costs $8000-9000 with about 60% for buying the 25 Robotis Dynamixel actuators required. The full BOM is available here >> [Bill Of Material](hardware/doc/BOM.md).

**The STL files are available in [the releases](https://github.com/poppy-project/poppy-humanoid/releases) of this repository.**

Then the process to assemble a complete Poppy Humanoid takes about 7h for  handyman people. Yet the skills required are very limited and should not be a problem for anyone able to hold a screwdriver.

The assembly process is fully documented with video tutorials.

**For more informations, refer to the [assembly instructions](hardware/doc/Poppy_Humanoid_assembly_instructions.md)**.

### Install poppy-humanoid
#### Install a Poppy board
Poppy Humanoid is made to work with an Odroid U3 or an Odroid XU4. We provide our own [system image](https://github.com/poppy-project/poppy-humanoid/releases) (based on Ubuntu 14.04) that can be directly copied to the SD-card or MMC. You can refer to the [documentation](http://docs.poppy-project.org/en/installation/burn-an-image-file.html) for more details. Note that if you buy it as a kit from one of the reseller you will also get a pre-installed SD-card.

### Install the software tools locally
If you want to install the software tools locally and not use the embedded board to control the Robot or if you are working with the simulator, you will have to install Python. We strongly recommand using a pre-packaged distribution as [Anaconda](http://continuum.io/downloads) and install the [poppy-humanoid](https://github.com/poppy-project/poppy-humanoid/tree/master/software) package (the easiest way is via pip).

You can also use our setup script directly on a Odroid based on Ubuntu or Debian. **Be aware tough that it takes some time and some good knowledge of Linux** This script is used to setup the Odroid to match our needs (custom Python, setup the web interface, a Poppy user...).
```
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/poppy-project/odroid-poppysetup/master/poppy_setup.sh -O poppy_setup.sh
sudo bash poppy_setup.sh poppy-humanoid
```
**For more informations, refer to the [poppy documentation](http://docs.poppy-project.org/en/installation/install-a-poppy-board.html)**.


#### Install on your personnal computer
If you want to install the software locally and not use the embedded board to control the robot or if you are working with the simulator, you will have to install Python. We strongly recommand using a pre-packaged distribution as [Anaconda](http://continuum.io/downloads) and install the [poppy-humanoid](https://github.com/poppy-project/poppy-humanoid/tree/master/software) package (the easiest way is with `pip install poppy-humanoid`).

**For more informations, refer to the [poppy documentation](http://docs.poppy-project.org/en/installation/index.html)**.

## The Poppy project history

The Poppy project is born in 2012 in the [Flowers laboratory](https://flowers.inria.fr/) at [Inria Bordeaux Sud-Ouest](http://www.inria.fr/en/centre/bordeaux).
It was initiated during [Matthieu Lapeyre](https://github.com/matthieu-lapeyre)'s PhD Thesis surpervised by [Pierre Yves Oudeyer](http://www.pyoudeyer.com/). At the beginning, the development team was composed by [Matthieu Lapeyre](https://github.com/matthieu-lapeyre) (mechanics & design), [Pierre Rouanet](https://github.com/pierre-rouanet) (software) and [Jonathan Grizou](http://jgrizou.com/) (electronics).

This project is initially a fundamental research project financed by [ERC Grant Explorer](http://erc.europa.eu/) to explore the role of embodiement and morphology properties on cognition and especially on the learning of sensori-motor tasks.
